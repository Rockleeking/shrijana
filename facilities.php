        <div class="AccordionPanelContent"><img src="ms_image/fac_interhouse.jpg" style="float:left; margin:5px 5px 5px 0;" />All the students from Nursery to grade Ten (10) have been divided into four different houses (groups) viz. Danphe - Blue colour, Laligurash - Green colour, Mt. Everest - Yellow Colour, And Simrik - Red colour. Each house is provided with House Masters and House perfects. Under their Supervision, Many inter-house competitions are held from time to time where all the students have change to participate. This practice of dividing the students in Houses is to build-up their strength, potentiality, talent and skill within themselves to bring a feeling of competition among themselves.</div>

A good school must possess the new technology i.e. computer for the students. THE COMPUTER has become to improve good knowledge and technique about the second source of knowledge. <br /><br />
          The School has introduced the computer section since 2006 A.D. Each and every student from standard three to nine has to attend the computer practical classes each day or alternate. It is a compulsory class, conducted thrice a week for both lower secondary and higher secondary. School also has internet access by which students can keep themselves abreast with the changing world. However, we have to say that there is not enough number of computers.</div>

A necessary section for an ideal school is the collection of the different varieties of books with it.

I have already said above that the eyes absorb eighty percent of your life situations - they are the most alive part. If you can see something, there is no need to memorize it; but if you listen to something, you have to memorize it. The school sees to it that the students can have on-the-spot observation of what they learn in class as far as practicable. The school has been conducting several educational tours in class wise order. The locations are especially different places of historical importance and industrial areas inside the valley.
